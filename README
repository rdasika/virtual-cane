README

Hey guys, thanks for reading.

Notes to consider:

    - i2c.h was copied from an example project. It is NOT our work.

    - virtual_cane.c, accelerometer.h, pwm.h, lidar.h, haptic.h, 
    and edge.h are our work.

    - edge.h is located in the branch "modes"

    - everything else in in "master"
Tom
